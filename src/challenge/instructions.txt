ArrayList<Team> teams;
Collections.sort(teams);



1. Create a generic class to implement a league table for a sport
2. The class should allow teams to be added to a list, and store a list of teams that belong to the league.
3. Your class should have a method to print out the teams in order, with the team at the top of the league printed
    first.
4. Only teams of the same type should be added to any particular instance of league class - the program should
    fail to compile if an attempt is made to add an incompatible team.
